    > We can use images "BY ONLINE" and "BY OFFLINE" 

    > You will also often see an <img> element use two other attributes that specify its size:
 
    > HEIGHT: This specifies the height of the image in pixels.

    > WIDTH:- This specifies the width of the image in pixels.

        >
    > <img>:- To add an image into the page you need to use an <img> element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes:

    > src:- This tells the browser where it can find the image file. This will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your own site. (Here you can see that the images are in a child folder called "images".

    > alt:- This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.
