   > EXTRA-MARK UPS
          In this chapter, we will explore additional markup features in HTML that enhance the structure, styling, and semantics of web content. This includes understanding doctype declarations, comments, attributes, and the differences between various elements.
   > DOCTYPES
          A doctype declaration informs the web browser about the version of HTML the page is written in. It is the first line in an HTML document and is crucial for ensuring the browser renders the page correctly.
   > COMMENTS IN HTML
   > ID ATTRIBUTE
   > CLASS ATTRUBUTE
   > DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ID AND CLASS
   > Block Elements
        < Some elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window. These are known as block level elements.
        < Examples of block elements are <h1>, <p>, <ul>, and <li>. 
        < Create a list of Block Elements
   > Inline Elements..
        < Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements. These are known as inline elements.
        < Examples of inline elements are <a>, <b>, <em>, and <img>.
        < Create a list of Inline Elements
   > Difference Between Block Elements and Inline Elements 
   > Grouping Text & Elements In a Block...."<div>"
   > What is <div>, its usecase, kyepoints, importance and etc.
   > The <div> element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box.
   > Grouping Text & Elements Inline."<span>"
   > What is <span>, its usecase, kyepoints, importance and etc.
   > The <span> element acts like an inline equivalent of the <div> element. It is used to either:
        1. Contain a section of text where there is no other suitable element to differentiate it from its surrounding text.
        2. Contain a number of inline elements The most common reason why people use <span> elements is so that they can control the appearance of the content of these elements CSS.
        ● You will usually see that a class or id attribute is used with <span> elements:
        ● To explain the purpose of this <span> element
        ● So that CSS styles can be applied to elements that have specific values for these attributes
