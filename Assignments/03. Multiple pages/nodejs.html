    <h1>Introduction to Node.js</h1>
    <h5>Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any
        kind of project!</h5>
    <h5>Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to
        be very performant.</h5>
    <h5>A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set
        of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally,
        libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather
        than the norm.</h5>
        <h5>When Node.js performs an I/O operation, like reading from the network, accessing a database or the filesystem, instead of blocking the thread and wasting CPU cycles waiting, Node.js will resume the operations when the response comes back.</h5>
        <h5>This allows Node.js to handle thousands of concurrent connections with a single server without introducing the burden of managing thread concurrency, which could be a significant source of bugs.</h5>
        <h5>Node.js has a unique advantage because millions of frontend developers that write JavaScript for the browser are now able to write the server-side code in addition to the client-side code without the need to learn a completely different language.</h5>
        <h5>In Node.js the new ECMAScript standards can be used without problems, as you don't have to wait for all your users to update their browsers - you are in charge of deciding which ECMAScript version to use by changing the Node.js version, and you can also enable specific experimental features by running Node.js with flags.</h5>

        <h5>The most common example Hello World of Node.js is a web server:</h5>
